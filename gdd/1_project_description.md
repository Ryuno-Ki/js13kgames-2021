# Combat Scorched Earth from Outer Space

Combar Scorched Earth from Outer Space combines card game with a space theme.

Under the effect of gravity the hero moves across the screen while the player
must find matching cards to save her from running into obstacles while also
collecting power ups to repair the ship and not die off.

Given the size limit, this entry will only have one level to demonstrate
the core mechanics and hint on extensions if it is received well.
