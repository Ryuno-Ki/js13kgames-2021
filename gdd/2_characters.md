# Characters

Casimir barely escaped the accident and now drives through the spaceship.
Help him survive and repair the ship so he can find a safe place.

Casimir is trained to survive in outer space, but feels best when having to
work with his hands. Thinking is not his strong suit. He prefers to spring
quick into action instead.
