# Story

Casimir was busy preparing for his day shift as an asteroid crashed into the
spaceship. Somehow, it managed to remain unseen and approached from a dead
angle. Now the integrity of the station is in danger, so action has to
happen quickly. Luckily, Casimir's spacesuit was near by. But the energy
level could not charge completely, so a tradeoff is needed to not die off
while repairing the environment.

## Theme

This game is about making decisions. There are two conflicting aims, that
needs to be balanced. I'm not a fan of fast-paced games, but will use the
amount of moving objects to build up difficulty.
