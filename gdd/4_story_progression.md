# Story Progression

Due to the space limit, a short dialog will explain the background story and
put the player onto the first level. Here, things move slowly, so there is
enough time to plan actions. The gravity level is barely noticeable.

As time moves on, more items appear in shorter succession and the boundaries
move towards to the middle, so wrenches are needed to push them back to buy
time.
