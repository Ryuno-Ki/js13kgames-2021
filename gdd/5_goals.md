# Goals

Survive as long as you can.

There is no winning condition, but the highest time can be saved in
browser storage to compete against oneself.

## User Skills

I assume the players to be adults. They need to be able to make quick
decisions while analysing and constantly reevaluating the situation.
Life points compete with integrity of the spaceship.

## Game Mechanics

Normally, this game would be implemented using Flappy-Bird like mechanics
(moving up, perhaps even down) to sidescroll through a level.

Instead, I want to combine it with a card game.

From right, new items will move through space. I limit it to two until I am
sure to have space for more.

## Items and power-ups

üç® (ice cream) for food and üîß  (wrenches) for repairs.
Alternatively üîã (battery) that can be invested into either system.

I imagine some gambling akin to [Blackjack][blackjack]
(but with 13 as magic number).
Once a player wins, the won energy has to be invested into either ship
repairment or life supporting services. Then the next round starts.

## Progression and challenge

The speed of items and approaching walls increase the pace of the game.
The decrease of either form of energy remains constant to make it not too
hard.

## Loosing condition

On contact with walls or running out of energy (life, integrity), the game
ends.
