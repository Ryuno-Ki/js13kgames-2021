# Art Style

Since black appears too jarring, I go with a dark blue. Ideally midnight
blue. It will be contrasted by shining colours like gold.

To give it a futuristic look and feel, there will be no sharp corners.
Instead, whereever possible, circles are used (but bounding rectangles for
collision detection). This will make the game feel more pleasant to play.
