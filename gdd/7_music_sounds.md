# Music and Sound

To save disk space, the music will resemble 8bit or chiptunes.
It would be great if it could be generated, so it could adapt to the speed
of the level.

There are sound effects on card movements (draw, pick, guess) and collision
detection of the hero with an item.

Movement of the walls happen in waves and are introduced by some sound
effect.

Outside of the game, the music slows down to allow for some relax and making
a decision on the next move.

Somehow the player should feel not too bad when loosing.
