# Marketing

Since the source code has to be hosted on GitHub as part of the competition
this game will be free of charge. Also, to remain available as educational
source, I publish it under a copyleft license (GPL v3 or newer).

The game is advertised by word of mouth on Twitter.

## Demographics

Age: 20 and older

Gender: any (I expect more males, though)

Casual players, who will spend a couple of minutes at most.

## Platform

The Web is the Platformâ„¢.

## Localization

English only. I don't have space for more. I tried in the past.
