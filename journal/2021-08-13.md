# 2021-08-13

Today was the first day of #js13kgames competition.
I actually managed to find the time to participate on the
[kick-off event][kickoff] over Zoom. Now I want to have some ice cream
(watch the video to understand). The [slides][slides] are available online.

Next to plenty of resources (see below), I got to know some people of the
community. I'm a bit disappointed, that the community uses Slack, as I
outright refuse to join on that platform. Work made me realise, it's too much
of a timesink for me. But I haven't shown up on Discord for months, so who am I
to complain.

## Today's achievement

I set up my boilerplate repo:

[commit diff 02320d1f41d51d84a890ed5846a091208080d6cb to 1e43390e0442b0d52991db5720d3e21560232ec6][diff]

### Setup

I used today to set up my repo with all the linters and quality gates and stuff
I want to respect (perfectionism and so on). This way, I've get it out of my
way and don't have to bother with it down the road.

With the tools I learned about today, I might get around to replace parts of
it. But that would be premature optimisation at this point.
Speaking of tooling, here's a list of what I learned about today:

- Inline everything (images can be turned into base64 or SVG)
- Prototype early (on different devices)
- Browse itch.io for assets
- Don't neglect music and sound effects
- Fun is more important than graphics
- Get the build process right early on (zip and within limits)

#### Tooling

- [Squoosh][squoosh]
- [Bits and Bites][bitsnbites]
- [Sprite generator][sprites]
- [ECT bin][bin]
- [ZzFX][zzfx]
- [ZzFXM][zzfxm]
- [miniMusic][minimusic]
- [MiniSoundEditor][minisoundeditor]
- [CSSprite][cssprite]
- [3Dmapeditor][3dmapeditor]
- [CSS3Dframework][css3dframework]
- [Emoji][emoji]
- [Terser][terser]
- [Gyro][gyro]
- [Tinyfont][tinyfont]
- [Efficient Compression Tool][ect]
- [advancecomp][adv]
- [Gute][gute]

Many, MANY more are listed on [resources][resources].

## Next steps

Now that I have the boilerplate in place, I can make my head free to think
about what to actually build. Here, I plan to keep a Game Design Document,
since it provides me with a framework that I hope will help me think things
through. Also, I bought some (paper) notebooks, to scribble things down.
Sounds like that's something other game devs did in the past to great success.

I plan to host this game on my own domain and use GitHub as a mirror.
Sadly, the rules make me use GitHub. I can understand why, but it doesn't help
me with getting away from this platform.

This journal will help me as a guidance, so I can focus my Postmortem on
actual challenges instead of trying to recapitulate, what I did the past 30
days or so.

I also read [Twitter][twitter] to see what others think about it.

Since it is possible to submit more than one entry, I should also take a look
at the categories and check, whether decentralised or server works for me.
Those tend to be less crowded. Also, I wanted to try IPFS anyway
(but GameDev.js Jam was too short-spanned for this).

### Codewise

- [ ] Optimise post-process script to remove references to stylesheets when
  they got inlined.
- [ ] Strip CSS of comments (but keep license banners).
- [ ] Assume a browser that understands ES modules and tweak rollup accordingly
- [ ] Minimise HTML
