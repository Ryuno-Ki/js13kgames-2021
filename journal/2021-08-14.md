I took to heart the recommendation to grab a paper notebook and collect ideas.
My first move was digital, though.

I looked for inspiration:

- [thesaurus][thesaurus]
  - yielding `area`, `arena`, `capacity`, `distance`, `field`, `location`,
    `slot`, `spot`, `territory` and `zone` as synonyms as well as `time`.
- [Dribbble][dribbble]
  - [Cosmic][cosmic] made me think on negative space or whitespace as a
    mechanic
  - [Space explore][explore] reminded me on some CSS page I ran into months ago
    (You can find similar ones by searching for „futuristic” or „VR UI” it
    seems)
  - [Sketchbook squad][sketchbook] was a game I used to play on Firefox OS back
    in the days. It's actually the idea I want to try out this year.
- [Flickr][flickr] was not yielding much.
  - [Space.][space] draw my attention to it. It could be something about
    respecting the comfort zone of others.
- DOS games. It inspires me to see, what previous engineers did with limited
  resources available to them. Next to DOS games, you can find ideas in early
  handheld console games. [Qix][qix] is something, I loved to play.
- [Unsplash][unsplash]
- Creative Commons search did not resulted in anything I consider interesting
  to share.
- [Freesound][freesound] could inspire me with finding sounds that fit to a
  game.

## Today's achievement

I researched and found a minimal physics engine:

### Game ideas

Following are keywords, that crossed my mind during research:

- S.P. Ace (a cards game?)
- Sketchbook Squad-like game: an astronaut running out of energy and jumping
- Timelapse (goes in the direction of [ReflectoLabs Inc][reflectolabs]
- Space Available (shrinking world; filled with a substance or similar)
- Paintball with some obstacles (WebGL?)
- Qix (multiplayer, one providing sound turned into EQ, the other moving line)
- Free fall or gravity 0 as a mechanic
- Office Space (looking at The Situation)
- Optical illusions (M.C. Escher)
- Viewpoint related game (ala [Track not Found ?!][track])
- Triangulation (determining position in space)
- Disk Space (like the joke of two sys admins SSHing into each others machine
  and deleting files in turn until one server crashes)
- Vacuum in glass (interesting physical effects)

## Next steps

I decided to go with the Sketchbook Squad-like idea for now. That made me
search for a physics engine. The [resources][resources] page listed
[Mini2Dphysics][physics] here.

For the Paintball idea, I would need some form of [raycasting][raycasting].
I defer that to later.

In the evening, I studied the code and ported it over to my entry (with
JSDoc annotations and tests).

### Codewise

- [ ] See ToDos from [yesterday][yesterday].
- [x] Implement more parts of the physics engine.
- [x] Consider using Nunjucks for interpolation to simplify post-processing.
