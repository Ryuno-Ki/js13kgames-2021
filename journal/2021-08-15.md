Since I could paint my hero onto the next screen, the next step was adding
gravity. I suceeded at this aspect!

With that in my pocket, I looked into adding boundaries, so I could have a
first prototype ready. Sadly, this turned out to be trickier than I thought.
Also, it's prone for me to overthink.

My current strategy (checking for two intersecting line segments) clearly have
some shortcomings. But now I can add test cases to investigate these more in
isolation.

Also, I was informed, that geometric algebra isn't that widely known. Once I
wrapped my head around what's going on here, I can add some pictures and
explain the logic.

## Today's achievement

I implemented gravity and have first boundary and collision checks in place:

## Next steps

I want to have collision checks working flawlessly. Then, I can refactor the
code to make gravity be a variable and include a range slider so I can tweak
the gravity and see the effect on the canvas. It's a first playable prototype
at that point. Also, it allows me to change the gravity between levels.

Once I get that in, I will add some kind of energy levels. This should split
up in life support systems as well as transport. It could look a bit like in
[Sword Art Online][sao]!
