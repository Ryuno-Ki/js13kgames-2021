I am now *master of the ~galaxy~ gravity*!

Ahem.

I mean, I can now control the gravity via input range so I can control the
movement of my box.

The precondition was solving the collision detection from yesterday.
I took the time and [explained the logic][cramer] in an issue against xem's
repo.

If you have more parts that pique your interest, let me know. I plan to write
more about geometric algebra as I go along.

## Today's achievement

I implemented gravity and have first boundary and collision checks in place:

## Next steps

Sadly, `canvas` (the package) is required by `jsdom` to manipulate a canvas
element. That would mean a compilation, which is reportedly not possible on
CentOS (what my hoster uses). I have to rip out JSDom as a consequence.

Zach recommended [linkedom][linkedom].
I expect this problem to take considerable amount of my time.

### Codewise

- [x] See ToDos from [yesterday][yesterday].
- [x] Replace JSDom with an alternative.
