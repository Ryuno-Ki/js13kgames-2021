# 2021-08-17

Do you know those days, when you can barely sleep because your mind bursts
full of ideas? I had that last night.

So today I set down and got them out of my head for the major part.

## Today's achievement

I was quite busy today.

I started with updating dependencies, added some colour, a favicon, ripped out
JSDom and instead use sinon now, so I can actual check for a call to stroke
the hero.

Then I started to add a second range input, so now the hero can move along
both dimensions! For that, additional boundaries were needed.

I added a way to reload the page to reset the page, but that's a bit flaky on
Firefox. Also, the game now has a settings and game-over scene.

With all of that, you can play it on my own domain now:
[Play it online][demo].

## Next steps

I need a way to reset to the initial state, so I can properly reset the state.
Also, now would be an ideal time to start writing my Game Design Document,
since I have everything in place to develop the game I want to submit.

### Codewise

- [ ] See ToDos from [13th August][start]. (Yes, I solved everything after!)
- [ ] Figure out how to include icons.
- [ ] Look into including [ZzFX][zzfx].
- [ ] Configure [MathJax][mathjax], but without a CDN.
- [ ] Look into [loading custom JavaScript and CSS in Gitea][css] to render
  MathML / MathJax / ASCIImath.
