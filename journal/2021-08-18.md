## Today's achievement

I did some research today to find a vision of the mood I want to evoke.
The font could be [Audiowide][audiowide].
I'm not sure, how large the zip will become since fonts tend to be large.

From a colour palette, I'm pretty much sold on gold-on-midnightblue.
So I looked for a [palette][palette] to much it.

During research, I noticed, that circular design feels pretty much
futuristic. I also browsed through Magic: The Gathering cards as they have
amazing artwork!

So â€¦ I tried to look into whether `<canvas>` can be made circular.
It can! With a `border-radius` you can cut corners.

I always struggle with finding good names and was amazed to discover a
[name generator][names] online! Why haven't I thought earlier about looking
for one?!

With all these information packed I went ahead and wrote a
[Game Design Document][gdd]!

## Next steps

I want to sleep over my shot, to see, whether the idea of two hours worth of
conscious work holds water.

- [ ] See ToDos from [yesterday][yesterday].
- [ ] More ideation
- [ ] Blackjack game logic research
- [x] Card design research

### Codewise

I think, some refactorings could ease the next step.

- [x] Create a file to hold references to DOM elements (to avoid null checks)
- [x] Move update-functions for position and physics into dedicated files
