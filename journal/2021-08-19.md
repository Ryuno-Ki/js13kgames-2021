## Today's achievement

Work is wearing me down somehow. Nevertheless I committed to push the needle,
even if it is only for a little. Overwork isn't healthy though, but what shall
you do if the team is understaffed?

Today, I thought about the device used to play this game and want to explore
whether a larger screen like on tablets would allow for better placement of
gamebits. Therefore, I scaled up the `<canvas>` knowing that it won't be
usable on a smartphone screen anymore.

I used [Screen Size Map][ssm] to get an idea about the viewports most in use.

I did a bit of research regarding card design and found

Maybe I can sneak in some geometric SVGs? That would be amazing!

## Next steps

I need to try out the new layout and check, whether it feels natural.

### Codewise

I think, some refactorings could ease the next step.

- [ ] See ToDos from [yesterday][yesterday].
- [ ] Refactor collision detection to use a callback function.
- [ ] Clean up `requestAnimationFrame` calls at game over.
- [ ] Introduce some kind of counter for points.
- [ ] Cap velocity of objects.
- [ ] Remove rotation properties as they aren't used anyway.
