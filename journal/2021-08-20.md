## Today's achievement

Inspired by a [tweet][tweet] I was wondering, whether I could get away cheaply
by using boxes with eyes. Perhaps with a mouth and eyebrows.

A quick look at facial expressions lead me to think, that it can be used in
different places:

They can be combined by using eyes and mouth!

## Next steps

I will scribble some ideas of how I can use pixel art to represent different
types of objects. I have to be on the road tomorrow anyway.

I can also pick up my paper notebook again and think about how to lay out the
elements of the game.
