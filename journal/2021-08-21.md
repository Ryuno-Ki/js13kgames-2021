## Today's achievement

The morning started badly. A personal thing, I won't talk about it in a
journal like this.

However, it blocked me from concentrating on the game I worked on. So instead
I tried to shift to something else to distract me.

Namely, implementing a [Styx][styx] clone. The sample server implementation
had a symmetric implementation, though. I focussed on the first part.

[commit diff b301f10c25c01e9025bbec1414ddcd9a86a24f89 to 24d7723ac785282f6427cc9e65e5a922fee5b507][diff]

It also requires a deployment to Heroku, so [play it there][heroku].

## Next steps

Before picking colours, I want to have the second player use the arrow keys to
move the part the player used in the original game.

### Codewise

- [ ] See ToDos from [yesterday][yesterday].
- [x] Refactor code into dedicated files including tests.
- [x] Implement arrow key navigation.
- [x] Offer choice which side to play.
- [ ] Turn into readonly mode after two players started playing.
- [ ] Offer to pick up the side disconnected.
