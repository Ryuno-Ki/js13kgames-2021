## Today's achievement

I had a free Sunday and utilised it!

Today, I implemented large parts of the opponents side and made sure I keep
both sides in sync. I'm not totally happy, but I can see the parts coming
together.

At this point I can imagine, that it is possible to imagine the flow.
So I can focus on polishing the game now!

To ensure that I can easier debug, I added tests for most of the files.
They're not that easy to test, but that is caused by global state. Something
I should tackle soon. I'm quite disappointed to use the Node `assert` function.

On the bright side, I can claim to have contributed to the server starter by
bumping the required Node version to 12 (current Long Term Support).

## Next steps

Before picking colours, I want to have the second player use the arrow keys to
move the part the player used in the original game.
