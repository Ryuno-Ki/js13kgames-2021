## Today's achievement

I spent today's afternoon and evening, so I merely

- added some accent colour used for the links between the scenes,
- pulled the element references out of the state object. This will allow me to
  compute the state on the server and push that to every client. I also
- added a meter which I will use to display the current state of the game
  (cleared to N %) and
- added ZzFX.

Quite a bummer, that it is hard to integrate with CommonJS (tests) and ESM
(my code). I worked around by polluting the `window` object for now.
