## Today's achievement

I noticed some e-mails about my Heroku builds failing, so I looked into it and
could fix them. While I was looking into the dashboard, I noticed that the
instance is hosted on US servers. That will make me add more privacy notices
about where data will be stored to grant users kind of a conscious choice.

The other major part of today was taken by moving the user management to the
server. I refactored the existing logic. Next step will be looking into what
parts of the User and Game class I still need.

I catched up on Twitter and want to look into whether I find something small
in the [midi][midi] collection I was recommended.

Lastly I thought about how I could describe my game. I think, it reminds me on
school days when I played [Dots and boxes][dab]. Since I want to support
multiplayer, it will be interesting to think about what happens if one player
is disconnected (my current approach is to scrap everything). That will also
trigger a recursion to check for open polygons. I'm especially eager to see
whether people will play together or against each other.

The competitive part comes from playing against the host who will be in control
of the mill.

I originally thought about using `getUserMedia` (webcam or microphone) as
input source. It shouldn't be much to query for permission. But how do I
broker it among everybody? A permission screen and some kind of lobby to get
ready will be required.

## Next steps

- [ ] Fill some Game Design Document pages.
- [ ] Research, whether [getUserMedia][getusermedia] is the only bit needed.

### Codewise

- [ ] See ToDos from [yesterday][yesterday].
- [x] Refactor `User` and `Game` class to work on object literals.
- [ ] Start working on artificial intelligence.
