## Today's achievement

Today, I worked more on refactoring the logic from the client to the server.
So far, I could port the host logic (although I believe it is not completely
correct at this point) and get rid of the initial Game and User class from the
seed repository. Logging happens now on every dispatch.

I discovered, that I need to have a matchmaking screen. While I am at it, I
will break up the form into several pages.

[commit diff d1f8126e00ff0286c8a3cd4ee41cc7b367f067b4 to 51b04b85c1c0c2624953d7f70234459a048ada42][diff]
